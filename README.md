🌟 30 Days of React – My Learning Journey

Hi! I’m Abhishek, and this repository is my space to document my 30-day journey of learning and improving React.
I started this challenge to push myself, stay consistent, and build the real skills needed to become a confident frontend developer. Every day I’m learning something new — sometimes small wins, sometimes big breakthroughs — but the goal is always the same:
Become better than yesterday.

🌱 Why I’m doing this
I’m not from a traditional software background. I’m learning and growing step by step.
This journey helps me:
Build real React projects
Understand concepts deeply instead of rushing
Create a strong portfolio for internships
Stay consistent and accountable
Improve confidence as a developer
Most importantly, this is my way of showing my dedication and discipline to recruiters, mentors, and myself.

🚀 What this journey includes
Throughout these 30 days, I will learn and practice:
React setup & environment
Components, props, and JSX
Lists & conditional rendering
Reusable components
Hooks (useState, useEffect)
Forms & events
Routing
API calls
Small projects
Building clean UI
Debugging & best practices
Along the way, I’ll also share small projects, screenshots, thoughts, and code improvements I make.

🔥 My Goals
Become confident with React fundamentals
Build real projects that I can show to recruiters
Improve problem-solving and clean coding habits
Stay consistent for 30 days (no excuses!)
Build a strong online presence
Get closer to my first internship or developer role

🧠 My Mindset for this Journey
I’m not here to be perfect.
I’m here to learn, grow, and keep going.
Some days will be difficult.
Some concepts will take longer.
But every day will take me one step closer to becoming a better developer.
